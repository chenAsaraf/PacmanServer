The scenarios can be divided into four types:

Scenario # 1 :  files number: 1 , 2

No blocks and ghosts, only pacmans

Scenario # 2 :  files number: 3 , 6

No pacmans and ghosts, only blocks

Scenario # 3 :  files number: 4 , 7

No ghosts, only pacmans and blocks

Scenario # 4 :  files number: 5 , 8 , 9

The most complex scenario - there are pacmans, obstacles and ghosts trying to eat the main player

The Algorythm:

General principle: 
The pacmans help the player finish the game faster, they eat the fruits and the player can eat the fruits and the pacmans.
After the game ends the remaining time will be points in my favor.

Note: The pacmans will have less weight than the fruits.
When calculating the algorythm, we will take into account the distance and weight of the targets, so if there is a pacman that is not close enough to the main player it wont get priority
In each scenario the best score will be made if the player will be inserted on a group of fruits.

**On the 8's scenario our best score was 48.6**
